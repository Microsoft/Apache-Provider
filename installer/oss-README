Building the Apache OMI Provider

Prerequisites
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. At least one modern Linux system with:
    a. root login capability
    b. These build tools:
        i.   GNU Make
        ii.  g++
        iii. pam-devel
	iv.  openssl-devel
    c. Open Management Infrastructure (OMI) 1.0.8.
       (Download from: http://theopengroup.org/software/omi)
       Note that you need BOTH the binary packages, omi-1.0.8.1.packages.tar.gz,
       as well as the source distribution file (omi-1.0.8-1.tar.gz).
    d. For compiling provider, you need the Apache development package for your
       distribution. For example, this is package httpd-devel (on Redhat).

       To installl/run the provider, you need the httpd server installed (package
       httpd or apache2, depending on your distribution).


Building the Apache OMI provider
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Extract oss-apache.tar.gz into a directory that you will build it from.
   This will create an "apache" directory like this:

   apache/apache   (directory with contents)
   apache/omi      (no contents under this directory)
   README          (this file)

2. Change directory (cd) into directory apache/omi and extract the OMI source
   file downloaded above. After extraction, you should have a single directory
   named "omi-1.0.8". Rename this directory to "Unix" (capital U is important).

   From the base apache directory, things should now look like:

   apache/apache/...
   apache/omi/Unix/...
   README          (this file)

3. Building the Apache provider:
   A.  cd apache/apache/build
   B.  ./configure
   C.  make

4. Installing
   A. Install the appropriate kit for your system from the binary file,
      omi-1.0.8.1.packages.tar.gz (downloaded earlier).
   B. Install apache provider:
      i.   cd apache/apache/build
      ii.  sudo bash
      iii. make install
   C. Configure OMI
      i.   Locate OMI registration directory. Depending on what version of OMI
           you installed, it could be in one of two possible places:
             /opt/omi/etc/omiregister
             /etc/opt/omi/conf/omiregister
      ii.  Create directory root-apache in this OMI registration directory
      iii. Copy Apache's OMI registration file, from Apache base directory, file
           installer/conf/omi/ApacheHttpdProvider.reg, to the directory that you
           just created above.
      iv.  Restart OMI (see OMI documentation on how to do this)
   D. Configure Apache:
      i.   Run: /opt/microsoft/apache-cimprov/bin/apache_config.sh -c

           Note: If you encounter permission problems loading the mod_cimprov.so
           library, this may be due to SELINUX permissions problems. Be certain
           that either SELINUX permits mod_cimprov.so to be loaded by Apache, or
           disable SELINUX on your system.

5. Test the provier
   A. To test the provider, run a command like:
        /opt/omi/bin/omicli ei root/apache Apache_HTTPDServer
      If the command succeeds, then the Apache provider is running properly. The
      complete list of classes that the Apache provider can enumerate are:
        Apache_HTTPDServer
        Apache_HTTPDServerStatistics
        Apache_HTTPDVirtualHost
        Apache_HTTPDVirtualHostCertificate
        Apache_HTTPDVirtualHostStatistics
